# The Krane Project

Krane is an open-source project inspired by [now](https://vercel.com/), [exoframe](https://github.com/exoframejs/exoframe), [render](https://render.com/), [dokku](http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/), to easily deploy dockerized apps to the cloud.

It provides the framework that can be installed on an inexpensive linux server on any cloud. The [cli](https://github.com/biensupernice/krane-cli) is how you communicate to krane and manage your deployments.
